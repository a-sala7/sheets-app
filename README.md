# SheetsApp

Small and simple angular application developed for a client with full server-side pagination support.  
Displays a student's logged classes, used for sending students a single link to their sheets without having them see or log into the internal management system (.NET API/Blazor) which was developed by yours truly. :)

Note: I don't plan on open-sourcing the management system itself. But if you are interested, check out my graduation project MetaHR!

The back end uses a very similar architecture to that project, in fact its somewhat better in architecture and code quality in general. I also contributed to its React front-end.
